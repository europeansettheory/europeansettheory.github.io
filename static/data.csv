And, if you think about monoids at all, you noted that it applies in a limited way to monoids. The notion of a Cayley monoid is just an internalization of this type of representation. There are many examples of Cayley monoids. Some of these are obtained from the group of a monoid acting on the monoid itself. There are some interesting special cases of Cayley monoids with strong <_{L} commutativity properties . An example is provided by the monoid Z*Q where Q is the quaternion group. In these cases we say that the Cayley monoid has an autonomous commutator. Here will will show that every monoid can be extended to a Cayley monoid with an autonomous commutator.";"See the seminar webpage.";""

Generalizing this concept, given a cardinal κ, I call an object <κ-blurrily ordinal definable if it belongs to an ordinal definable set with fewer than κ elements (called a <κ-blurry definition). By considering the hereditary versions of this notion, one arrives at a hierarchy of inner models, indexed by cardinals κ: the collection of all hereditarily <κ-blurrily ordinal definable sets, which I call <κ-HOD. In a ZFC-model, this hierarchy spans the entire spectrum from HOD to V.
The special cases κ=ω and κ=ω1 have been previously considered, but no systematic study of the general setting has been carried out, it seems. One main aspect of the analysis is the notion of a leap, that is, a cardinal at which a new object becomes hereditarily blurrily definable.
In this talk, I will focus on the ZFC-provable structural properties of the blurry HOD hierarchy, which turn out to be surprisingly plentiful. So for the most part, the talk will be forcing-free. Time permitting, I may hint at the result of the equiconsistency between the least leap being the successor of a singular strong limit cardinal and the existence of a measurable cardinal, for which, admittedly, forcing is used in one direction.";"The talk will take place in hybrid mode.

The talk will cover the main result of my master’s thesis: A complete axiomatization of modal inclusion logic. We begin by recalling that modal inclusion logic is expressively complete for classes that have the empty team property, are closed under unions and closed under k-bisimulation for some k. Through the expressive completeness proof, we obtain a normal form for the logic. In the talk, we suggest a simplified version of the normal form compered to the one currently in the literature.

This group is obviously interpretable (indeed definable) in the field F. Mal’cev showed that one can recover F from G(F), and indeed that there is an interpretation of F in G(F) using two parameters. Any two noncommuting elements of G(F) can serve as the parameters, but Mal’cev was unable to produce an interpretation without parameters. 
After introducing the notions of a computable functor and an effective interpretation, we will present joint work showing that there is an effective interpretation of each countable field in its Heisenberg group, without parameters, uniformly in F. (That is, the same formulas give the interpretation, no matter which field F we consider.) Moreover, from the effective interpretation we will then extract a traditional interpretation without parameters, in the usual model-theoretic sense. Finally we will note that, whereas Mal’cev’s result actually gives a definition of F in G(F), there is no parameter-free definition of F there.

He used what came to be known as Jensen’s forcing to show that, consistently, there can be a Π12-definable non-constructible real. The ‘uniqueness of generic reals’ property of Jensen’s forcing extends to products of Jensen’s forcing and to finite iterations, when forcing over L. Indeed, a Jensen-like forcing with the same uniqueness properties can be constructed in any universe with a ♢-sequence. In a joint work with Friedman and Kanovei, we used a tree iteration of Jensen’s forcing to construct (in a symmetric submodel of the forcing extension) a model of full second-order arithmetic Z2 with the choice scheme in which the dependent choice scheme failed for a Π12-assertion (this is optimal because Z2 with the choice scheme implies dependent choice for Σ12-assertions). In this talk, I will present a generalization of Jensen’s forcing to forcing with perfect κ-trees for an inaccessible cardinal κ. I will show that Jensen’s forcing at an inaccessible has the same ‘uniqueness of generics’ properties as Jensen’s forcing.

A cardinal κ is Laver-generically supercompact for P (or P-Laver-gen. supercompact for short) if, for any λ≥κ, P∈P and (V,P)-generic G, there are P-name ˙Q with ∥–P“˙Q∈P” such that, for all (V,P∗˙Q)-generic H⊇G, there are j, M⊆V[H] such that j:V≺→κM, j(κ)>λ, and P∗˙Q, H, j”λ∈M. 
Perhaps it is not apparent at first sight in the formulation the definitions above but these notions of generic large cardinals are first-order definable (S.F, and H. Sakai [1]). 
While the generic supercompactness does not determine the size of the cardinal. Laver-generic supercompactness determines the size of the cardinal and that of the continuum in most of the natural settings of P (see S.F., A.Ottenbreit Maschio Rodrigues, and H. Sakai [0] for a proof): 
(A) If κ is P-Laver-gen. supercompact for a class P of posets such that (1) all P∈P are ω1preserving, (2) all P∈P do not add reals, and (3) there is a P1∈P which collapses ω2, then κ=ℵ2 and CH holds. 
(B) If κ is P-Laver-gen. supercompact for a class P of posets such that (1) all P∈P are ωpreserving, (2)’ there is an a P0∈P which add a real, and (3) there is a P1 which collapses ω2, thenκ=ℵ2=2ℵ2. 
(C) If κ is P-Laver-gen. supercompact for a class P of posets such that (1)’ all P∈P preserve cardinals, and (2)’ there is a P0∈P which adds a real, then κ is very large and κ≤2ℵ0. 
The case (C) can be still improved ([0]): 
(C’) If κ is tightly P-Laver-gen. supercompact for a class P of posets such that (1)’ all P∈Ppreserve cardinals, and (2)’ there is a P0∈P which adds a real, then κ is very large and κ=2ℵ0. 
(A P-Laver-gen. supercompact cardinal κ is tightly P-Laver-gen. supercompact, if ˙Q in the definition of Laver-gen. supercompactness can always be chosen to be small enough — see [0] for a precise definition.) 
In this talk, we are going to give a sketch of the proof of definability and discuss about a theorem which assesses the largeness of κ in (C) under the additional assumption that elements of P satisfy certain chain conditions.

One can view it as a variant of Kechris, Pestov, and Todorčević theory in the context of (complete first order) theories. I will discuss several ‘definable’ Ramsey-theoretic properties of first order theories and their dynamical characterizations. The point is that all the Ramsey-theoretic properties that we introduce involve ‘definable colorings’ and the dynamical characterizations are ‘dynamical properties of the theories’, i.e. they are expressed in terms of the action of the group of automorphisms of a monster (i.e. sufficiently saturated and homogeneous) model of the theory in question on the appropriate space of types. One of the basic results says that a theory has the definable Ramsey property iff it is extremely amenable (as defined by Hrushovski, Pillay and myself). But there are various other results, some of which are essentially new and may be surprising in comparison with the Kechris, Pestov, Todorčević theory. One of the motivations to study those properties was to understand better the so-called Ellis group of a theory (which was used by Pillay, Rzepecki, and myself to explain the nature of the Lascar Galois groups of first order theories and spaces of strong types, and led E. Hrushovski to some original development with striking applications to approximate subgroups). Using our dynamical characterizations, we obtain several criteria for profiniteness and for triviality of this Ellis group, with many examples where they apply. I will try to discuss it during my talk. If time permits, I may very briefly mention an abstract generalization of the above considerations and results, which also applies both to the context of definable groups as well as to the classical context of Kechris Pestov, Todorčević theory, leading to some new notions, results, and questions.";"The talk will take place in hybrid mode.

A cardinal κ is Laver-generically supercompact for P (or P-Laver-gen. supercompact for short) if, for any λ≥κ, P∈P and (V,P)-generic G, there are P-name ˙Q with ∥–P“˙Q∈P” such that, for all (V,P∗˙Q)-generic H⊇G, there are j, M⊆V[H] such that j:V≺→κM, j(κ)>λ, and P∗˙Q, H, j”λ∈M. 
Perhaps it is not apparent at first sight in the formulation the definitions above but these notions of generic large cardinals are first-order definable (S.F, and H. Sakai [1]). 
While the generic supercompactness does not determine the size of the cardinal. Laver-generic supercompactness determines the size of the cardinal and that of the continuum in most of the natural settings of P (see S.F., A.Ottenbreit Maschio Rodrigues, and H. Sakai [0] for a proof): 
(A) If κ is P-Laver-gen. supercompact for a class P of posets such that (1) all P∈P are ω1preserving, (2) all P∈P do not add reals, and (3) there is a P1∈P which collapses ω2, then κ=ℵ2 and CH holds. 
(B) If κ is P-Laver-gen. supercompact for a class P of posets such that (1) all P∈P are ωpreserving, (2)’ there is an a P0∈P which add a real, and (3) there is a P1 which collapses ω2, thenκ=ℵ2=2ℵ2. 
(C) If κ is P-Laver-gen. supercompact for a class P of posets such that (1)’ all P∈P preserve cardinals, and (2)’ there is a P0∈P which adds a real, then κ is very large and κ≤2ℵ0. 
The case (C) can be still improved ([0]): 
(C’) If κ is tightly P-Laver-gen. supercompact for a class P of posets such that (1)’ all P∈Ppreserve cardinals, and (2)’ there is a P0∈P which adds a real, then κ is very large and κ=2ℵ0. 
(A P-Laver-gen. supercompact cardinal κ is tightly P-Laver-gen. supercompact, if ˙Q in the definition of Laver-gen. supercompactness can always be chosen to be small enough — see [0] for a precise definition.) 
In this talk, we are going to give a sketch of the proof of definability and discuss about a theorem which assesses the largeness of κ in (C) under the additional assumption that elements of P satisfy certain chain conditions.

One can view it as a variant of Kechris, Pestov, and Todorčević theory in the context of (complete first order) theories. I will discuss several ‘definable’ Ramsey-theoretic properties of first order theories and their dynamical characterizations. The point is that all the Ramsey-theoretic properties that we introduce involve ‘definable colorings’ and the dynamical characterizations are ‘dynamical properties of the theories’, i.e. they are expressed in terms of the action of the group of automorphisms of a monster (i.e. sufficiently saturated and homogeneous) model of the theory in question on the appropriate space of types. One of the basic results says that a theory has the definable Ramsey property iff it is extremely amenable (as defined by Hrushovski, Pillay and myself). But there are various other results, some of which are essentially new and may be surprising in comparison with the Kechris, Pestov, Todorčević theory. One of the motivations to study those properties was to understand better the so-called Ellis group of a theory (which was used by Pillay, Rzepecki, and myself to explain the nature of the Lascar Galois groups of first order theories and spaces of strong types, and led E. Hrushovski to some original development with striking applications to approximate subgroups). Using our dynamical characterizations, we obtain several criteria for profiniteness and for triviality of this Ellis group, with many examples where they apply. I will try to discuss it during my talk. If time permits, I may very briefly mention an abstract generalization of the above considerations and results, which also applies both to the context of definable groups as well as to the classical context of Kechris Pestov, Todorčević theory, leading to some new notions, results, and questions.";"The talk will take place in hybrid mode.

This group is obviously interpretable (indeed definable) in the field F. Mal’cev showed that one can recover F from G(F), and indeed that there is an interpretation of F in G(F) using two parameters. Any two noncommuting elements of G(F) can serve as the parameters, but Mal’cev was unable to produce an interpretation without parameters. 
After introducing the notions of a computable functor and an effective interpretation, we will present joint work showing that there is an effective interpretation of each countable field in its Heisenberg group, without parameters, uniformly in F. (That is, the same formulas give the interpretation, no matter which field F we consider.) Moreover, from the effective interpretation we will then extract a traditional interpretation without parameters, in the usual model-theoretic sense. Finally we will note that, whereas Mal’cev’s result actually gives a definition of F in G(F), there is no parameter-free definition of F there.

Generalizing this concept, given a cardinal κ, I call an object <κ-blurrily ordinal definable if it belongs to an ordinal definable set with fewer than κ elements (called a <κ-blurry definition). By considering the hereditary versions of this notion, one arrives at a hierarchy of inner models, indexed by cardinals κ: the collection of all hereditarily <κ-blurrily ordinal definable sets, which I call <κ-HOD. In a ZFC-model, this hierarchy spans the entire spectrum from HOD to V.
The special cases κ=ω and κ=ω1 have been previously considered, but no systematic study of the general setting has been carried out, it seems. One main aspect of the analysis is the notion of a leap, that is, a cardinal at which a new object becomes hereditarily blurrily definable.
In this talk, I will focus on the ZFC-provable structural properties of the blurry HOD hierarchy, which turn out to be surprisingly plentiful. So for the most part, the talk will be forcing-free.
