Topics:

    Stationary-Tower-Free Proof of Woodin’s Sealing Theorem, Sandra Müller
    Generic absoluteness theorem for the omega_1 Chang model conditioned to MM^{+++}, Matteo Viale

This is a learning seminar, the goal is to actually go over proofs and more or less understand them. Discussions are encouraged.

Please contact Grigor Sargsyan for more information.";"September 27, 2022.";""

Core Model Seminar:  1:30 – 3 PM, Online, Nam Trang, University of North Texas

TITLE:  Core model induction toolbox and examples, part 1

ABSTRACT: We discuss the relevant concepts and tools that go into a core model
induction through L(R) (or more generally through models of the form
Lp^\Sigma(R)). We provide examples (PFA, the existence of an \omega_1-dense
ideal on \omega_1 etc) that illustrate how these concepts are used in practice.";"September 6, 2022.";""
"Webmaster";"Announcements, Online Activities ";"Stuk 8 in Leeds, Friday 16 September";"This is a reminder that the next iteration of Set Theory in the UK will be held in person at the University of Leeds on Friday, 16 September 2022. We are pleased to announce that we will have talks by Azul Fatalini, Jan Grebik and Dorottya Sziraki.

During the day there will be an opportunity for people to give minitalks (around 15 minutes). We particularly welcome PhD students and those new to the community to introduce themselves and what they are currently working on. If you are interested in giving such a talk, please contact one of us: Richard Matthews (R.M.A.Matthews@leeds.ac.uk) or Jiachen Yuan (j.yuan@leeds.ac.uk).  At the end of the day there will be a conference dinner. If you would like to join this, please contact one of us so that we can have a rough idea of numbers. We kindly ask that you let us know if you would like to give a talk or join for dinner before Friday, 9 September so that we can plan accordingly.

Please forward this announcement to any students or other people who might be interested in attending.  Please can you also let us know if there is anyone who hasn’t received this email and should be added to our mailing list.

We look forward to seeing you all at the meeting,

"Webmaster";"Job, Announcement";"5th Hausdorff Medal 2022";"he Hausdorff committee unanimously recommended that the 5th Hausdorff Medal 2022  be awarded to David Aspero (University of East Anglia) and Ralf Schindler (University of Münster). The ceremony took place at the European Set Theory Conference in Turin on 29 August 2022.

The medal was awarded for their positive solution to the long standing conjecture. Their proof showed that MM++, a strong form of Martin’s Maximum, implies Woodin’s Axiom (*). This result amalgamates two approaches to understanding the theory of sets of size less than the second uncountable cardinal. The outcome shows that determinacy approaches are intimately connected with those of forcing axioms, and unifies our two most important ways of thinking about sets in this area.

The committee therefore cited the following paper for its fundamental contribution:

–  David Asperó and Ralf Schindler: Martin’s Maximum++ implies Woodin’s Axiom (*), Annals of Mathematics 193 (3) (2021), pp. 793-835.

Philip Welch, President of the European Set Theory Society

The ceremony on 29th August, 2022 included a laudatio by Grigor Sargsyan and talks by the medal winners:
– Video of the ceremony
– Laudatio
– Slides of Ralf Schindler’s talk
– Slides of David Aspero’s talk

The Hausdorff medal was designed by Maria Clara Cortés, professor at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia.";"September 1, 2022.";"https://ests.files.wordpress.com/2022/09/trediloro.jpeg"

August 29th-September 2nd, 2022
Turin, Italy

Although the conference is conceived as an in-person event, the current worldwide situation is still preventing many people from traveling. Therefore we decided to add a new registration option for online participation: this will give the possibility to those who cannot attend in person to access all talks and ceremonies (Hausdorff medal etc…) through the video conferencing platform Webex. Details can be found here. Registration is possible till August 22nd.

Please share this announcement with all people who might be interested in the event (more information on our website).

We are looking forward to welcoming you (in person or online)!
