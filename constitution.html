Although its activities are centred in Europe and the Associated States, the Society is open to set theorists worldwide, and its actions are carried out in cooperation with researchers in countries outside Europe and with bordering areas of research. The Society aims to create a dynamic research and training network in order to ensure a leading position for European set theory and bring this subject to a higher level. The Society shall have the following powers:
